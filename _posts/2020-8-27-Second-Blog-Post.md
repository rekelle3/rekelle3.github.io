Coming into this course, I had a little bit of experience working with R from previous courses at NCSU. Over the course of undergraduate and graduate school, I have gotten the opportunity to work with other software/languages including MATLAB, Stata, Java, and SAS. I find myself gravitating towards R the more I use it and learn how robust it truly is. 

One functionality I enjoy about R is the extensive help resources that are available, both within the R help files and general community. There is a bit of a learning curve to reading R documentation files, but once I figured out the general layout, I found them to be quite helpful. Another capability I appreciate is how flexible the language is. Instead of repeating a set of actions, repeatedly, we can write a function to have R do this for us.

One feature I miss from other languages is the simplicity in objects. For example, MATLAB utilizes one type of object, arrays. I find it easy to get confused when you have all of these different object types, with a specific method for each type of object. Another functionality I miss is how some languages treat missing values over R's treatment. For example, SAS exlcudes missing values automatically when calling a proc step, without including some sort of additional argument. I prefer not needing to include the additional argument required by R in order to exclude missing values. 

When I was first exposed to R, I did find certain aspects of the language difficult. First, I found it difficult to wrap my head around the idea of packages. In most other languages, you just call a function without having to think about whether you loaded in a package or not. Also, I find that a lot of R’s syntax is not all that intuitive. I find that I know how I logically want to approach a problem; I am just not always sure of how to translate that way of thinking into R’s syntax. This is still something that I struggle with today but is improving as my R skills progress. Despite these struggles, I am finding it enjoyable to work with R overall.
