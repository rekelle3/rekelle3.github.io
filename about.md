Hello! My name is Rachel, welcome to my blog. This is my first go at blogging, so please excuse any mistakes I may make along the way. I believe the general theme of this blog will be data science, mathematics, and statistics; however, this is subject to change.

### More Information

Now a little about meâ€¦ I am a twenty-four-year-old financial specialist at a non-profit organization that provides services to individuals with developmental disabilities. This keeps me engaged for most hours of the work week; however, I am also a part time graduate student. I am halfway through the online Master of Statistics program at North Carolina State University. After I graduate, I would love to continue applying my statistical knowledge to the human services field. 

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending as much time outdoors as possible. I enjoy camping, hiking, and boating with dog. His name is Kody. He is an eleven year-old dachshund shih-tzu mix. Other hobbies and passions of mine include reading, video games, drawing, and painting.

Thanks for stopping by and reading my blog!
